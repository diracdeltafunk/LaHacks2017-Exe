# Entraîner

As math majors, we are often frustrated by the scarcity of low-cost, high-quality practice problems available for the material we learn. While the internet has revolutionized many areas of education, it’s the case that in order to get (for example) challenging group theory problems, you must buy a textbook. Our goal at LA Hacks was to solve this issue by creating a free, general-purpose problem generator.

Currently, entraîner generates integration problems, although our code is fully generalizable, with the potential to produce problems about:
* Asymptotic Runtime (Computer Science)
* Abstract Algebra (Mathematics)
* Argument Validity (Logic)
* etc.

Essentially, entraîner can be configured to produce any kind of problem with step-by-step solutions. Moreover, entraîner can show the step-by-step solution to each problem it generates. Because of the high granularity of control you get over the problem generation, this becomes a very helpful tool for students who want to drill certain problem-solving techniques. Students can register accounts to save their problems and see their progress over time.

Entraîner also includes features for instructors. Teacher accounts can create classes, post customized assignments to those classes, and see how their students did on those assignments. Cheating becomes much more difficult, because entraîner randomly generates different problems for each student.

Currently, the entraîner website is set up to generate integration problems. To check it out, go [here](35.185.203.129)! (Unfortunately, the site is not yet mobile-friendly.)


Kyle:

Teachers are the building blocks of our future. They empower students to strive for excellence, in turn shaping the course of the world we live in. However, as students we have often noticed the difficulties teachers - especially math teachers - face in handpicking practice problems for their students. When choosing problems from a textbook, as most math teachers do when in need of practice problems, teachers must decide between picking solved problems and risking students simply copying down the answers from the back of the book or picking unsolved problems and wasting valuable class time going over them in class so that each student knows what they did right and wrong.

To solve these problems, we created Entraîner, a free, general-purpose problem generator. Currently, entraîner generates integration problems, although our code is fully generalizable, with the potential to produce problems in any subject for a vast range of educational levels:
* Simplifying expressions (Pre-Calc)
* Asymptotic Runtime (Computer Science)
* Abstract Algebra (Higher Mathematics)
* Argument Validity (Logic)
* etc.
In addition to its flexibility of design, Entraîner also empowers instructors with its vast range of features and student statistics along with an intuitive interface. Teacher accounts can create classes, post customized assignments to those classes, and see how their students did on those assignments. Cheating becomes much more difficult, because entraîner randomly generates different problems for each student.

However, this is not all. What truly distinguishes Entraîner from other problem-generators like WolframAlpha is its customizability. Conventional problem-generators for integrals aren't very powerful as they only give basic exercises using a single algorithmic technique. On the other hand, teachers and students using Entraîner can choose from a variety of difficulties and techniques, generating more interesting problems to challenge students to truly digest the material they are learning.

Entraîner even comes with step-by-step solutions for each problem which are hidden until after the student has guessed the right answer or given a number of wrong guesses configurable by their instructor.
